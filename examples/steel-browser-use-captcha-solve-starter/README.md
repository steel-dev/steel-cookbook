# Steel Browser Use Captcha Solver Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate Steel with the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) framework to create an AI agent capable of interacting with Steel and solving Captchas. It leverages Steel's session management to provide a secure, cloud-based browser instance for browser-use to connect to and Steel's Captcha solving capabilities to solve any Captchas encountered.

## Features

- Seamless integration between Steel and browser-use
- Cloud-based browser automation with Steel sessions
- AI-powered browser interaction using OpenAI GPT-4o
- Captcha Solving capabilities with Steel
- Automatic cleanup of resources
- Robust error handling and session management

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Python package manager (Recommended `uv`: `pip install uv`)
- Steel API key (Get 100 free browser hours [here.](https://app.steel.dev/sign-up))
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-cookbook.git
   cd steel-cookbook/examples/steel-browser-use-captcha-solve-starter
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment with venv:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies using venv:**

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

   Note: We're using venv to manage our environment and pip to install the packages. This ensures all dependencies are resolved consistently using pip's dependency resolution. If you're having issue with speed or dependencies, feel free to switch back to python/pip and try these steps again.

4. **Copy the environment variables file and configure your API keys:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:**

   ```env
   STEEL_API_KEY=your_steel_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the example with:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:

1. Create a new Steel session
2. Connect browser-use to the Steel session using the WebSocket URL
3. Execute the AI agent's task (e.g., summarizing the Steel Docs changelog)
4. Automatically clean up resources when done

## How It Works

1. **Session Creation**: The script creates a Steel session with optional proxy and CAPTCHA-solving capabilities.

2. **Browser Integration**: The WebSocket URL from the Steel session is passed to browser-use's Browser configuration.

3. **AI Agent Setup**: A browser-use Agent is created with:

   - The specified task
   - OpenAI GPT-4o language model
   - Browser instance connected to Steel
   - Captcha Solving tools

4. **Execution**: The agent runs autonomously, performing the specified task.

5. **Cleanup**: Resources are properly released, including:
   - Closing the browser connection process
   - Releasing the Steel session

## Error Handling

The example includes comprehensive error handling:

- Validation of required environment variables
- Try/except blocks for session management
- Proper cleanup in case of failures
- Informative error messages

## Customization

You can modify the example by:

1. Changing the task in `main.py`
2. Adjusting Steel session parameters
3. Configuring different browser-use settings
4. Adjusting Steel Captcha solving tools
5. Using a different OpenAI model or adjusting model parameters
