<Intro skipLink="#full-code-example">
  Control Steel's managed browser infrastructure with Playwright in Python for reliable web automation without the headaches.
</Intro>

<Step number={1} title="Install Playwright and Steel SDK">
  Run the following command to install Playwright and the Steel SDK.
  ```bash
  pip install playwright steel-sdk
  ```
</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Start a Steel Session">
  Create a Steel session to get a remote browser instance that you can control with Playwright.

  ```python showLineNumbers filename="main.py" /YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY/#1
  from steel import Steel
  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

  # Initialize Steel client with API key
  client = Steel(steel_api_key="YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY")

  # Create a Steel session
  session = client.sessions.create()

  print(f"View live session at: {session.session_viewer_url}")
  ```
</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Connect Playwright to Your Session">
  Connect Playwright to the running Steel browser session using the CDP protocol.

  ```python showLineNumbers{12} filename="main.py" /YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY/#1
  # Start Playwright and connect to the Steel session
  playwright = sync_playwright().start()
  browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(
      f"wss://connect.steel.dev?apiKey=YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY&sessionId={session.id}"
  )
  ```
</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Perform Browser Automation">
  Now that Playwright is connected, you can add your own automations. Here's an example that scrapes Hacker News headlines.

  ```python showLineNumbers{18} filename="main.py"
  print("Navigating to Hacker News...")
  page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com", wait_until="networkidle")

  # Find all story rows
  story_rows = page.locator("tr.athing").all()[:5]  # Get first 5 stories

  # Extract the top 5 stories using Playwright's locators
  print("\nTop 5 Hacker News Stories:")
  for i, row in enumerate(story_rows, 1):
      # Get the title and link from the story row
      title_element = row.locator(".titleline > a")
      title = title_element.text_content()
      link = title_element.get_attribute("href")

      # Get points from the following row
      points_element = row.locator(
          "xpath=following-sibling::tr[1]").locator(".score")
      points = points_element.text_content().split(
      )[0] if points_element.count() > 0 else "0"

      # Print the story details
      print(f"\n{i}. {title}")
      print(f"   Link: {link}")
      print(f"   Points: {points}")
  ```
</Step>

<Step number={6} title="Release the Session When Done">
  Close the browser and release the session to free up resources when your automation is complete.

  ```python showLineNumbers{44} filename="main.py"
  # Clean up resources
  browser.close()
  client.sessions.release(session.id)
  ```
</Step>

<Step number={7} title="Run Your Script" isLast>
  Execute your script to start a Steel-powered browser session. You can view your session live in the Steel Session Viewer.

  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
</Step>

<FullCodeExample id="full-code-example" title="Full Example">
  Complete code example that combines all the steps above.
  ```python showLineNumbers filename="main.py"
  from steel import Steel
  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

  # Initialize Steel client with API key
  client = Steel(steel_api_key="YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY")

  # Create a Steel session
  session = client.sessions.create()

  print(f"View live session at: {session.session_viewer_url}")
  
  # Start Playwright and connect to the Steel session
  playwright = sync_playwright().start()
  browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(
      f"wss://connect.steel.dev?apiKey=YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY&sessionId={session.id}"
  )
  
  print("Navigating to Hacker News...")
  page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com", wait_until="networkidle")

  # Find all story rows
  story_rows = page.locator("tr.athing").all()[:5]  # Get first 5 stories

  # Extract the top 5 stories using Playwright's locators
  print("\nTop 5 Hacker News Stories:")
  for i, row in enumerate(story_rows, 1):
      # Get the title and link from the story row
      title_element = row.locator(".titleline > a")
      title = title_element.text_content()
      link = title_element.get_attribute("href")

      # Get points from the following row
      points_element = row.locator(
          "xpath=following-sibling::tr[1]").locator(".score")
      points = points_element.text_content().split(
      )[0] if points_element.count() > 0 else "0"

      # Print the story details
      print(f"\n{i}. {title}")
      print(f"   Link: {link}")
      print(f"   Points: {points}")
  
  # Clean up resources
  browser.close()
  client.sessions.release(session.id)
  ```
