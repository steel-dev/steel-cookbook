  <Intro skipLink="#full-code-example">
    Control Steel's managed browser infrastructure with Playwright in Python for reliable web automation without the headaches.
  </Intro>

  <Step number={1} title="Install Playwright and Steel SDK">
    Run the following command to install Playwright and the Steel SDK.
    ```bash
    pip install playwright steel-sdk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Start a Steel Session">
    Create a Steel session to get a remote browser instance that you can control with Playwright.

    ```python showLineNumbers filename="main.py" /YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY/#1
    from steel import Steel
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

    # Initialize Steel client with API key
    client = Steel(steel_api_key="YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY")

    # Create a Steel session
    session = client.sessions.create()

    print(f"View live session at: {session.session_viewer_url}")
    ```
    - Replace <HighlightRef id={1}>YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY</HighlightRef> with your API key
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Connect Playwright to Your Session">
    Connect Playwright to the running Steel browser session using the CDP protocol.

    ```python showLineNumbers{12} filename="main.py" /YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY/#1
    # Start Playwright and connect to the Steel session
    playwright = sync_playwright().start()
    browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(
        f"wss://connect.steel.dev?apiKey=YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY&sessionId={session.id}"
    )
    ```
    - Replace <HighlightRef id={1}>YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY</HighlightRef> with your API key
  </Step>

  <Step number={4} title="Perform Browser Automation">
    Now that Playwright is connected, you can add your own automations. Here's an example that scrapes Hacker News headlines.

    ```python showLineNumbers{18} filename="main.py"
    print("Navigating to Hacker News...")
    page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com", wait_until="networkidle")

    # Find all story rows
    story_rows = page.locator("tr.athing").all()[:5]  # Get first 5 stories

    # Extract the top 5 stories using Playwright's locators
    print("\nTop 5 Hacker News Stories:")
    for i, row in enumerate(story_rows, 1):
        # Get the title and link from the story row
        title_element = row.locator(".titleline > a")
        title = title_element.text_content()
        link = title_element.get_attribute("href")

        # Get points from the following row
        points_element = row.locator(
            "xpath=following-sibling::tr[1]").locator(".score")
        points = points_element.text_content().split(
        )[0] if points_element.count() > 0 else "0"

        # Print the story details
        print(f"\n{i}. {title}")
        print(f"   Link: {link}")
        print(f"   Points: {points}")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step number={6} title="Release the Session When Done">
    Close the browser and release the session to free up resources when your automation is complete.

    ```python showLineNumbers{44} filename="main.py"
    # Clean up resources
    browser.close()
    client.sessions.release(session.id)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step number={7} title="Run Your Script">
    Execute your script to start a Steel-powered browser session. You can view your session live in the Steel Session Viewer.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  </Step>

  <FullCodeExample id="full-code-example" title="Full Example">
    Complete code example that combines all the steps above.
    ```python showLineNumbers filename="main.py"
    from steel import Steel
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

    # Initialize Steel client with API key
    client = Steel(steel_api_key="YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY")

    # Create a Steel session
    session = client.sessions.create()

    print(f"View live session at: {session.session_viewer_url}")
    
    # Start Playwright and connect to the Steel session
    playwright = sync_playwright().start()
    browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(
        f"wss://connect.steel.dev?apiKey=YOUR_STEEL_API_KEY&sessionId={session.id}"
    )
    
    print("Navigating to Hacker News...")
    page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com", wait_until="networkidle")

    # Find all story rows
    story_rows = page.locator("tr.athing").all()[:5]  # Get first 5 stories

    # Extract the top 5 stories using Playwright's locators
    print("\nTop 5 Hacker News Stories:")
    for i, row in enumerate(story_rows, 1):
        # Get the title and link from the story row
        title_element = row.locator(".titleline > a")
        title = title_element.text_content()
        link = title_element.get_attribute("href")

        # Get points from the following row
        points_element = row.locator(
            "xpath=following-sibling::tr[1]").locator(".score")
        points = points_element.text_content().split(
        )[0] if points_element.count() > 0 else "0"

        # Print the story details
        print(f"\n{i}. {title}")
        print(f"   Link: {link}")
        print(f"   Points: {points}")
    
    # Clean up resources
    browser.close()
    client.sessions.release(session.id)
    ```
